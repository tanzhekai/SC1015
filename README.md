## Problem Formulation (Motivation)
- According to the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an on-time flight is defined as one that arrives or departs in no more than 15 mins after the scheduled time.
- In 2019, the performance of US airlines in terms of timely arrivals was around 80%, with the average length of delay to be 50mins.
- As flight delays are caused by a variety of factors such as the weather, the air traffic congestions and many more, accurate predictions on which factors causes flight delays the most, can not only improve operational efficiency but also contribute to the entire aviation industry and its travellers.

## Problem Goal
- To predict the greatest factors causing flight delays.

### Data-driven Insights & Recommendations
Looking from the perspective of the 3 main groups of air travel, we can see that the variables we found can give insights on the best ways to reduce flight delays. 

1. For travellers, as concurrent flights are high during peak holiday seasons, travellers may choose to instead travel during less popular months. 

2. For the airlines, since the age of the plane is the most important variable that affects flight delays, the fleet management of airlines should prioritize using newer aircrafts to reduce maintenance time during peak seasons as well. 

3. Airports should also interact and work closely with each other to understand and allow efficient flight scheduling to reduce congestion. 

Although we are aware that these recommendations are common in air travel, learning how to apply models and predict flight delays by ourselves allow us to fully understand and solve our initial problem formulation in this project.
